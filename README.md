# Real SpeedTest
Know what is your download speed in real everyday usage, like when you are downloading things online.

## Introduction
A Speedtest from a speedtest service provider may not provide 100% real usage accuracy. Yes, it is accurate but the speedtest servers are only used for speedtesting. What will happen if you tested the real website? Then, try Real Speedtest.

## How it works?
It uses the github pages' server (which is used by many open-source projects) to the test your download speed. So that we can see what is your download speed in real usage. No optimizations is applied, so that we can see the real values. Values are measured using JavaScript.
