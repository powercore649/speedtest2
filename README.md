# Real SpeedTest
Know what is your download speed in real everyday usage, like when you are downloading things online.

## Introduction
A Speedtest from a speedtest service provider may not provide 100% real usage accuracy. Yes, it is accurate but the speedtest servers are only used for speedtesting. What will happen if you tested the real multi-purpose used website server? Then, try Real Speedtest to find out.

## How it works?
It uses the github pages' server (which is used by many open-source projects) to the test your download speed using a 14.7MB image file. So that we can see what is your download speed in real usage. No optimizations is applied, so that we can see the real values. Values are measured using JavaScript.

## Why the results are changing and so unstable sometimes?
The results are changing every test because the load on the Github's server is changing and also your internet connection speed to the Github's server is changing.

That is why when you are using your internet to browse the web even your internet connection is 50MBPS and some websites are too slow because the servers of every website are not the same.
