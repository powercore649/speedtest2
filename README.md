# Real SpeedTest
Test your internet connection for download speed and latency in real life usage.

## Introduction
A Speedtest from a speedtest service provider may not provide 100% real usage accuracy. Yes, it is accurate but the speedtest servers are only used for speedtesting. What will happen if you tested the real multi-purpose used website server? Then, try Real Speedtest to find out.

## How it works?
•Download Speed Test - this uses a 14.7MB image file from the Github Pages and the download speed is being measured by HTML and a custom javascript code.
<br>
<br>
•Latency Test - this is being measured using jQuery and a custom javascript code and is testing the latency of Google's homepage.

## Is this speedtest designed for giving the worst results?
No, this is designed to give the results of an average website using an average server and infrastructure. This is not designed to just imitate the speedtest platforms but to give a realistic results if you browse the web.

## Why the results are changing and so unstable sometimes?
The results are changing every test because the load on the Github's and Google's server is changing and also your internet connection speed to the Github's server is changing.
<br>
That is why when you are using your internet connection to browse the web even your internet connection is 200MBPS and some websites are slow or too slow because the servers of every website are not the same, both in distance and in their hardware specifications.<br>
For simplicity, not every website owners have server capacity like Microsoft and Google or the server you are assigned on is much slower than the previous one (like change of the country/place on where the server is placed on)
## Accuracy
When you compare a normal speedtest tool, the result here and the result from the speeedtest tool will not match.
<br>
This will not match because the speedtest tool targets the maximum potential, but this tool targets the real usage when you download from the web or browse the web.
<br>
This speedtest tool demonstrates the scenario of a real webserver used for our daily web browsing.
<br>
Thus, making this tool 100% accurate on your daily usage of the internet.

## Definition of Terms
•Download Speed - it is the speed of transfer from the server to the client, measured in the primary unit of Megabits per seconds (Mbps) or in the secondary unit of Megabytes per seconds (MBps). So, to explain the difference, there are 8 bits in a single byte, and your ISP uses bits and your device uses bytes.
<br>
<br>
•Latency - it is the measure of the delay time from the client to the server, measured in miliseconds (ms).
<br>
<br>
•Server - it is where a service in the internet (like websites and email services) are hosted.
<br>
<br>
•Client - it is the device of the costumer that uses the specific service that gets the information from the server.
